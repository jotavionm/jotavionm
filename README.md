- 👋 Hi, I’m @jotavionm. I'm 32 Brazilian living in São Paulo trying to be best myself can.
- 👀 I’m interested in a bunch of science related stuff, but mainly on biology, medicine, and specially, astronomy. I love picturing myself as a tiny spec on the universe. We're so tiny :) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Sciences and Front-End Development. Also trying to catch up with my guitar since I've not played it since I was a kid.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that brings me joy and opportunity to learn. I'm at the very beggining and I'm a curious son of a gun. I'll do everything on my reach to learn as much as I can. 
- 📫 How to reach me: on my email: joao-otavio@outlook.com. I'm also available on LinkedIn and social media as João Otávio Nunes de Mesquita.
